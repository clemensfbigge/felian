            <h1>My past Projects</h1>
        
            <h2>Songwerkstatt</h2>
            <p>
                The Songwerkstatt is a songwriting course at the HMT Leipzig. The singers would meet in small groups and present to each other their ideas for a song corresponding to the theme of the semester. In this process over the course of a semester everyone writes a song, which will be presented with a band at the songwerkstatt-concert at the end of the semester. During my studies I had the blessing of being the musical director of the Songwerkstatt, which meant that I would organize the band and the rehearsals and play in the band. 
                Every semester I was astonished of the musical quality and especially the emotional depth of the compositions. Each and every semester the time of rehearsals and the concert was very special to me. Also this was my first to be on stage as a singer presenting my own song. The Songwerkstatt is without a doubt the most valuable part of my studies. „Es gibt immer was, was bleibt“ - „There will always be something that stays“ - Kai Dannowski

            <h2>Claudio Puntin Large Ensemble</h2>
            <p>
                In 2022 Claudio Puntin, one of the biggest clarinettists in europe came to the HMT Leipzig as a guest artist to rehearse and perform his compositions which he arranged for Large Ensemble. To me this music seems to be a mix of classical impressionism and contemporary, pop-influenced jazz. To experience his music, especially his harmonic language in his composition and the emotional depth of his playing on the clarinette with electronical adhancements has been extremely inspiring and has a longlasting effect on me. The concert was probably the most beautiful performance experience on the piano for me. I am so thankful for his music and the most inspiring talks i got to have with him.

            <h2>Rio Reiser - Mein Name ist Mensch</h2>
            <p>
                Rio might be my most special stage experience. This oiece of musical theatre shows the life of the underestimated german singer Rio Reiser. His impact on the german culture is as subtle as it is deep. Most germans know songs like „Wann“ or „König von Deutschland“, but don‘t know the name Rio Reiser. 
                2022 and 2023 I had the pleasure of being part of that amazing ensemble to become friends with Rio and perform the piece about 20 times over the course of a couple of weeks. 
                I have had some acting classes before but this was the first time for me to not only play piano and sing on stage, but also act and dance and even sing one song as frontman in a concert version of the show, which was the most intense stage experience I have ever made.

            <h2>Composing for Theatre - "Frauen vor Flusslandschaft" Theater Bonn</h2>
            <p>
                During studies I got accepted into the MentoringArts program and Malakoff Kowalski became my mentor. A mentorship quickly became a friendship and somehow we matched so well that we did some projects together. One was a piano music for a theatre piece „Frauen vor Flusslandschaft“ in the „Staatstheater Bonn?!?!?“, an adaptation of the piece from Heinrich Böll with the same name. To me it feels like every time we meet this creative room appears in which creative work just happens with ease. I came up with some compositions and ideas and we would work on them together and then he recorded me in his studio. He has this way that makes feel like every little, stupid is welcomed, needed and valuable. His encouragements came always exactly at the right moment with such security, that I never felt this frustrating feeling of being stuck, that I know so well in creative processes. Malakoff, you‘re the man. But get some rest!
