            <h1>About me</h1>

        
            <h2>My musical Journey</h2>
            <p>Growing up in a musical household musicians like Sting, Beatles, Genesis and Esbjörn Svensson accompanied me from early on. We where blessed with a very beautiful Instrument, so with the guidance of my mother I started to play around on the piano at the age of around 5. 
            <p>As a teenager I started playing piano in the childrens bigband of Michael Scheunemann, who told me to get a Jazz piano teacher. In that time period I became student of the jazz pianist Tim Sund and the classical Pianist Vida Kalojanova. In the last 2 years of school had some key experiences which lead me to pursue music after attaining the Abitur. I met Brad Mehldau's music on a concert of Mehliana back in 2013, which would become a constant motivation and inspiration. I got obsessed with the classical composition "The Campanella" by Franz Liszt, which lit up my obsession for music. And I got friend at school, another pianist, and we started improvise and compose and play together after school in the music rooms.</p>
            <p>I wanted to do my own stuff in music. So I prepared for studying jazz piano in the "Studienvorbereitende Ausbildung" or StuVo in short from 2015-2017. In that time I started to compose, play with other musicians in Bands and won awards as a Soloist, in Bands and as a composer. In 2017 as member of a Band I also represented Berlin in the national competition "Jungend Jazzt" in Saarbrücken.</p> 
            <p>From 2017 till 2023 I studied jazz piano the "Hochschule für Musik und Theater Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy" in Leipzig with Professor Michael Wollny and Frank Chastenier. I took that time to meet as many different musical corners as possible, playing film music with an orchestra or "Neue Musik" in chamber music ensembles or work out popsongs and original compositions in pop bands or working on a solo program between original compositions, free improvisation and classical music.</p>
            <p>I also took acting classes and made experiences in ensembles. So I came to act, play music, sing and dance in the musical theatre "Rio Reiser - Mein Name ist Mensch" by Frank Leo Schröder, which played in the "Komödie am Ku'damm" in the "Schillertheater" and in the "Heimathafen" in Berlin 2022 and 2023.</p>
            <p>Since I have finished studying, I started to engage more and more with producing and filmmusic.</p>
