            <h2>Monday</h2>
            <p>I decided to start documenting my process. So here it is.</p>
            <p>Today being monday is the first day of the third Felian. I am a little proud, because i managed to plan my whole week in advance to ensure that i have a little bit more time for Felian 3 then the previous one. Life being life a couple of minutes into my first session with F3 I started to get migrane. So... yeah fuck. Apparently I learned to get it a little under control, because now I am back at it. But I have to be careful.</p>
            <p>The way I set my scedule is basically one hour for the writing process and one hour for the Web Building process. In the 25 minutes or so that was left to me for the music part, I recorded a bunch of percussion noises, because I realised in my earlier F's the percussion part left much to wish for. So this is now my musical kickoff. I am a little sad about it, because the first priority of Felian is, that the music's that are being created must be a product of the necessity to deal with emotions, because music needs to be felt and not thought about logically. Because of that I am trying out this idea that feeling needs to come before technique. Well... since I am not building a jail for myself, it is okay, that in F3 that might not be the case. Just because here the Technique came before the feeling, doesn't mean, that there won't be the necessity of Emotion in the end product of F3.</p>
            <p>After handling my migrane, I gave myself 15 minutes for the Web Building process. I created individual pages for each F and a front end page for "Project Felian". Before I had two pages. Now I have five. It is nice to see my little family grow. Also nice to see, how "Project Felian" starts to get embedded in my actual Website, not being the only thing my site has to offer. Well I am getting ahead of myself. There is yet nothing but Felian and my page has not really a lot to offer, but a design that makes you wanna puke. So that is one of the big next challenge in the Web Building process. First I want to get the structure down. Today I got somewhere with that. Next is the design.</p>
            <p>My Alarm already rang and already stopped ringing while I was writing this. Not Sure, if I should continue. First I will make sure, that my migrane does not get out of control. CYA</p>
            <h2>Tuesday</h2>
            <p>Today was messy. Decided to not set my alarm. The Waking up felt great, but my whole day started to fall apart. But not because of the sleeping. I think it was my decision to not keep my scedule. In the second half of the day I planned to work 2 hours on Felian and one hour on my flat. Instead I started with my flat and never stopped. Also, I didn't get anywhere with my flat. I just rearranged my working room to check out some ideas and they just didn't work. So a big waste of time, except now I know they are crap.</p>
            <p>I finally worked on some music, means I cleaned up the recording mess my yesterday-self left me. Asshole. Was no creative work, but I got a little into the workflow with Reaper. The product is that there are a fuck ton of samples in my Arrange View. And I got a nice deep Bass Kick when I accidently pitched down a clap. Maybe that gets me somewhere tomorrow. Now I only have to get some work on the Web front done. CYA on the other side.</p>
            <p>Sidenote: Damn, I do a lot of mistakes writing in english. Sorry.</p>
            <p>Okay, I did some CSS stuff to get into the matter of layout. It is not easy. I need to make some progress in order to not get frustrated. Today I got my first basic layout of my website. I got a navigation in my header, my section where the stuff is happening and a footer, that is supposed to be at the bottom of the page, but is NOT. So the next thing to figure out is to get the footer at the bottom of the page, as well as getting my links on the right side of the page, while leaving my name on the left side. I got an idea there. I put an ul in my header with two li's. The first li is my name and the other on is the ul with my links. I want to try it now. <br> CYA.</p>
            <p>Okay, now I am done. The idea kind of worked and that gave me a little motivation boost, so I also put it on each page. For some reaason I had to correct the href system for the pages. So next is to put the footer at the bottom and make the color better. That might be it for this week. I am really behind scedule with the music and my flat. <br> CYA</p>
            <h2>Wednesday</h2>
            <p>So, this is it for today with the Web Building. I got some stuff done. I got the footer at the bottom now. Something is there, that I don't like. When there is enough content on the page, like it is here, to be able to scroll und you scroll down, the footer gets up in the end back down when you reach the bottom. It is okay, that it does, but I dont want to the background-color of the body beneath the footer. Also the footer needs to get a purpose. Ah, I know, maybe it should say that the Page is written by me? Let's see, if that feels right. Som kind of information should land there. <br> Okay, I also got a first draft of a part of the site that serves as an archive. I want to keep all my old versions of the Website, so one can retrace the development of this Site. It is going to be a challenge, because it basically means I need to organize place inside my Website for complete other Websites. And those continue get more and more and each of those are their own complete Website with links to all the pages inside that particular Website. I think I am going to need to expand this idea to layer navigation. Have a great day! <br>CYA</p>
            <p>Nope, something else that happened: I put my name on the left right of the navigation and home and Felian on the left. I googled how to do it and now the home button is gone. Maybe I find it somewhere in my flat later. What the Fuck? Well, also they stay, when you scroll down, which was unintended but is kind of cool. Maybe I do this with the whole navigation section. So now I am finished. Fuck off.</p>
            <h2>Friday</h2>
            <p>Well... in the end there is no percussion and I didn't to the search of my "Home"-link. It must be somewhere, because it is in the code. Next time I will get the archive ready and make sure the "Home"-link returns home. <br>Next upload next friday, as always around 4 pm. <br>Have a good weekend!</p>
