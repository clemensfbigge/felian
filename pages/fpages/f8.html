                <p>Oh man. Too little TIME!!! I decided to each week build the website again from scratch using the older versions, instead of copying the whole folder and just work on the new page. That way I learn more, don't forget how the stuff I did works and don't loose oversight. <br><br>I want to be done with the sizing for mobile versions. First I have to check how I can access the website from my phone, while working on it. Then I'll figure out which and how elements have to change with sizing. </p>
                <h3>Friday</h3>
                <p>OOOOKKKKKAAAAAYYYYYYY <br><br><br> I am fucking hyped. Thanks to the help awesome friend Toli and Chatgpt I managed to access the Live Server from my Phone and also develop the page specifically for the phone. The design is now more grey, which I like. There are here and there some minor sizing issues. But they'll be easy fixes. Man, this was a big step today. I really happy right now!!! <br><br><br>Now it 15:30 pm and haven't got any music done yet. So let's get some water and a power session in to create some music.</p>
                <p>alright. 4 pm. it is time to put it up. since i basically had no time, there is not much with this sound. This week I had the idea to play with an LFO on the Volume Envelope of a pad sound. Not much that came out of it. But that's okay. The Website is a little bit more important. Because I want it to be presentable in a few weeks. Alrighty. <br><br>CYA!!!</p>
