            <h2>Monday</h2>
            <p>So the 4th begins. Had a great sunday. Had a great monday. Except again, not much time. At least I could make it to start it. The Reaper file exists, well i still have to save, and now also the direction for the next Site-Version exists. In Reaper I took the track that I created last week, where sampled all the recorded percussion stuff and pinned it to the virtual midi keyboard, and copied it into the new one. Something came around and now I am stuck with that kind of childlike happy beat. Interestingly enough a pretty dark and dangerous got added to it. Feels weird. Let's see what will happen. This week on the web site of things I would like to find my home button, which, I am sure, still must be around here somewhere. I would like to incorporate a working archive section. And maybe I can start getting into Java to get some Pop-Up action and some... well some action in generell. <br>It is already 11:20 pm. My fingers are itching to get more stuff done, but I am already very late to finish my day. So I will resist the temptation. No actually fuck it. Everyday a little bit. I will take 7 minutes for Java and 7 for Linux. CYA Tomorrow.</p>
            <h2>Tuesday</h2>
            <p>I got some stuff on the music side done today. Somehow a lot appeared. I might have enough material already to get 1,30 full. I was thinking yesterday evening that I missed my idea by just starting a song with by playing with some percussion stuff, because I had the thought that I want to let each song be born in the necessity of expressing a certain feeling. But maybe one shouldn't plan to do this. The need to express is there in anyway. From there it might not matter what emerges first. <br>Well, on the Web side I decided, that the Archive is not for now. I will concentrate on something else. I can just for my self have my Marks but it is not necessary to display it on the web right now, maybe never. My biggest problem is dealing with positioning of the different sections. I need to go back there and really understand deeply how this stuff works. I think that only then i will get an overview how my website actually works and can work. CYA</p>
            <h2>Friday</h2>
            <p>Yeah, well it got dark. Again to little time. I have to upload in 10 minutes. So in short. I didn't get much in Web. In Reaper there was this new experience of a little more of this "everything is not so new anymore"-feeling, which is great and also completely wrong. Ah fuck. No time. Alright. As always: <br>Next Upload: Next Friday at 4 pm.</p>
