            <h3>Tuesday</h3>
            <p>On the weekend and today I decided to dive a little deeper into CSS positioning to feel more progress. Till now just practicing. Today I returned to this page and I decided to implement all the future links. Now I have more then 20 pages and it gets messy. When I modify the second navigation with all those links I have to copy the modification and paste into all the other 18 Felian pages. I wonder if there is the possibility to outsource part of my html code to one external file and link it in each file. Same procedure as with the stylesheet. Well. I am done for today. Bye!</p>
            <h3>Thursday</h3>
            <p>I am kind of done. Like, energywise. I decided, to make a new Stylesheet for each Felian site. That way there is the documentation on the site going on, but I don't have think about how to implement all versions into the most recent one. <br>I am still struggling with the positioning. I still don't really understand how absolute and relatve work. Also today the design changed and so I lost my Felian Navigation. Same thing as with the home button. I will find you guys. Maybe not this week. But after the holidays. Yes, after 5 I take the holidays, then for christmas. That's it. BYE!</p>
            <h3>Friday</h3>
            <p>I kind of hate these days a little. I don't have a title yet. Maybe it is "I hate these Days". But I don't really hate them. Well. <br> I still can't find the navigation for all the links for Felian. It is again nearly 4 pm and I again similar to the last couple of days, I haven't eaten yet. I am done. With everything right now. So, some links won't work, because I have reordered my directory system and haven't had the time yet to adapt the hrefs. <br>This is the last Felian of the first streak. The second is till christmas. And then there is the last one till first half of Feburary. <br>I am leaving a mess. But I can't anymore. <br>Have a great holiday.</p>
