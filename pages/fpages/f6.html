            <h3>Monday</h3>
            <p>Today is the first day I finally could reengage with this project. After all i fell in the winter. Much later than the last years. But it happened. I yet don't know what to make of the fact, that I can do it now with relative. In fact reengaging getting little rewards when fixing little problems gave me back a little of this feeling when I am able to work properly. Well let's see what happens. </p>
            <p>I met with my good old friend and he helped me with some positioning stuff and now i could finally realize some of my ideas that i had. Now I have a second navigation bar for Felian that is fixed on the right side. My header is cleaner. And some new colors. I decided to make my name the home button. The Navigationbar works pretty well. Next issues are to position the main content in a way it doesn't hide behind the bar. Also the positioning of h1-3 in main and the posiitoning inside the Nav-Bar. Hope I can solve some stuff with margin and padding.</p>
            <p>Oh, and I managed to keep the footer on the foot of the website :)
            <br><br>
            <h3>Wednesday</h3>
            <p>Ok. The stuff that I wanted to fix were easier, than I thought. The footer says something now. Stuff on the main is no longer behind the bar. And the headers are also positioned better.</p>
            <p>Positioning seems to get a little bit easier. Now it gets a little to how to make it, that it doesn't look so shitty.</p>
            <p>also Here ist another paragraph, because I want to see what happens, when the main content gets longer than the page. Especially with the Nav Bar. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Maxime ipsam recusandae, eveniet quae voluptatem aliquid iure odio quod quis assumenda provident ratione, ad minima in. Quaerat totam error quisquam fugiat. Ah well. I am not convinced yet. I gotta check the code of other websites, that I like. CYA</p>
            <h3>Monday</h3>
            <p>Here I am Back!!! The Winter got me. But now it is going on. This Layout actually happened in the winter. So I won't really make changes this week. But it is way better now. So I am going with every f page keeps its layout to document the progress. And maybe I should put the layout of the week als on the index. Yea. I'll do that today. But first I want to declare and define my goals. I want my page to presentable at the 27th of june. That gives 9 weeks. Here is what has to happen for this: <br>1.: The style should nice and professional <br>2.: The Architecture of the site should be clean <br>3.: The following content should be there: Pictures, about me-text, Dates-Section. <br>4.: empty pages for my music/film-music. <br>5.: Impressum/Contact <br>6.: Mobile Version <br>7.: Real domain. <br>Okay, let's get to work!</p>
            <p>Okay, done for the day. The index has the same style as f6 and it looks awesome. The Felian basic page is still in the style of an older Version. I might keep it that way or maybe I also put in that way. I don't know yet. Tomorrow I gotta update the Felian Navigation. It still has the F6-13 and then F14-19. Now I only got 9 left. Looking forward to tomorrow!!! Bye</p>
            <h3>Tuesday</h3>
            <p>Next day. Little tired. But still motivated. I updated the Felian links in the nav of F6 and on the Felian-Page. Also declared the font-size of the links in the nav in a way, that they scale when minimize or maximize the window. Because today I took up the thing about the mobile version. The Video I watched about it just said, that I have to make sure, that my page simply also works in the mobile view. I would have thought, that I have to make an extra Version for. I will have to check that. Gonna ask Miguel. I need learn how to get access to the local server of laptop with my phone, so I can work on the code while checking the changes also on my phone. That is for tomorrow. <br>Now to the music. I made a short loop with two chords and some voice-leading. Today I wanna see if I can add some percussion. Next maybe some guitar and higher harms and maybe some voice, and maybe another part with different harms.k</p>
            <h3>Friday</h3>
            <p>Yesterday and Wednesday I hadn't have the time. So I had to pull a quick one today. The music got a little Aufbau through the Rhythm Section. And I had to fix some path errors. Now we can hear the music again. Till next week! <br>CYA!</p>
